## üíª Project Structure

The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making use of classes and inheritance to structure the game logic and player interactions. Here's a breakdown of the core components:
- **Languages used is C++.
- **Main File**: The entry point of the project, where the game loop runs and interacts with the user.
- **Board Class**: The key class that handles the grid, player turns, and game logic for each variation of TicTac2.
